# DeepLearning---LSTM-Predictor
In this homework I first cleaned and split the data so that the model can ingest the data correctly for training and testing. I then ran the data through an 3 layer RNN LSTM model using the "fear and greed" index numbers. Then made predictions and plotted them against the test data. I repeated this process for the same model but with the closing prices instead of the fean and greed index. 

Which model has a lower loss?
The model using losing prices.
Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
The closing prices model.
Which window size works best for the model?
10.
